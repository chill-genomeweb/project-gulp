# Define environment variables. These variables will be available in the run
# task commands by concatenating the keys together in an uppercase string. For
# example, the value of env.default.alias can be used in a run task command as:
# $ENV_DEFAULT_ALIAS
#
# Default variables are available in every environment but values will be
# overridden if the variable is redefined for another environment.

# WARNING: This file is committed to the project repository. Do not put
# sensitive information into environment variables here. Use a local.project.yml
# or another method available to the environment that does not require
# committing the variable values to the repo.
